The Project:
- An application that reads in flight data from a csv file and then renders the data and allows a user to interact with it.


 How to set application up:
 Once you clone the repositorty onto your own machine you must download a list of libraries. There are two ways of doing this.
 
   1:
 The repository comes with a "libraries" folder. In here you will find all of the libraries needed to setup the project.
 You must drag all of the contents in the repository's "libraries" folder into your own processing "libraries" folder on your
 local machine. The default location of your processing "libraries" folder is:
 
   Windows:
   C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\Processing\libraries
   Mac OS:
   /Users/YourUsername/Documents/Processing/libraries
   Linux:
   /home/YourUsername/sketchbook/libraries


NOTE: replace "YourUsername" with your actual username on your system.


If you drag these libraries in and you run into issues, please follow the alternative method below.


  2:
Here we will just download each library manually in processing.When you have the code in processing open, click
on sketch -> Import Library -> Manage Libraries. Then type the library names into the searchbar and download all of
them. The library names are the file names inside the "libraries" folder of the repository. e.g Squarify.


Once you have done this the project should function properly.
